    Build a pet clinic that will include :
    -- veterinarian hub
    -- pet hub
    -- consult hub

    All the above windows must be in CRUD operations

    Veterinarian hub must contain :
    -- first name
    -- last name
    -- address
    -- speciality

    Pet hub must contain :
    -- owner name
    -- pet name
    -- birthday
    -- race
    -- is vaccinated

    Consult hub must contain :
    -- veterinarian
    -- pet
    -- date
    -- description

    For each hub you will need to build the following commands :
    -- create / add
    -- view all
    -- find all
    -- find by id
    -- update
    -- delete


    For more professionalism we will make an menu that contains all hubs
    and in each hub we will make its own menu
